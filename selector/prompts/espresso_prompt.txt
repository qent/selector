Selecting Elements with Espresso
1. Prefer resource ID: use onView(withId(R.id.your_id)) whenever possible.
2. Use content description for accessibility elements via withContentDescription.
3. Avoid matching on text unless it is stable and localized strings are not a concern.
4. Combine multiple matchers with allOf() to ensure uniqueness.
5. Interact with scrollable containers using RecyclerViewActions or scrollTo().
6. Avoid absolute view hierarchies; use withParent or isDescendantOfA sparingly.
7. Wait for asynchronous operations with IdlingResource instead of sleeps.
8. Write custom Matchers for complex cases and reuse them across tests.
9. Keep selectors short and focused on stable attributes only.
10. Validate that each selector matches a single view before using it in tests.
